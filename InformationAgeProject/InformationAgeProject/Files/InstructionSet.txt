Information Age is a game that lightly mimics the Scrum styled development process. Each player will manage their own development team. Each round represents one sprint. Each sprint has two phases, the initial team meeting, followed by the coding phase. The goal is to have the most successful development team by the end of the game.

Sprint Functionality:

Each player begins the game with five members on their development team. The initial team meeting is the planning phase for your project. You will delegate each of your members to any of the following categories of tasks: User Stories, Additional Project Features, Required Project Features, or Coding Proficiencies.

After each player has delegated their team members, the coding phase of the Sprint commences. During this phase, The Random Number Generator (R.N.G.) is used to determine how well the Sprint is Executed. 
For each task, the R.N.G. will be activated a number of times equal to the amount of team members allocated to that task. The resulting total number will decide the outcome for each task.

Example 1: Player 1 has 3 developers working on the User Story (Low Priority) task set, and activates the R.N.G. twice, obtaining a sum of 5. This would mean that 2 User Stories (Low Priority) were completed, because they are worth 2 points each. Any remainders after a performing division are not used.

Example 2: Player 2 has 3 developers assigned to the User Story (High Priority) task set, and activates the R.N.G. three times, obtaining a sum of 7. Player 2 has an available level 2 Coding Proficiency, and chooses to utilize their proficiency to boost their sum to 9. This would mean that 2 User Stories (High Priority) were completed, because they are worth 4 points each. Again, if there is a left over value from the R.N.G. sum, then the value is discarded.

Training and Coding Proficiencies:

The Training task set can only accept one developer per round. For example, if Player 1 sends one of their developers to Training, the Training task set is considered occupied and no other Players can send their developers to train for the rest of that Sprint.

After the Sprint is completed, the Player that occupied the Training task set will receive one Coding Proficiency for their development team. If the Player does not already have a Coding Proficiency, they will be awarded a single level 1 Coding Proficiency. If the Player already owns three Coding Proficiencies, an existing Coding Proficiency is leveled up by 1. All Coding Proficiencies must stay within 1 level of each other. Players are only allowed to keep a total of 3 Coding Proficiencies at a time. Each owned Coding Proficiency can only be used once per Sprint. You can use multiple Coding Proficiencies at a task. 

Example: Player 1 sends one developer to Training for Sprint 1. They already own two level 1 Coding Proficiencies , as well as a single level 2 Coding Proficiency. They cannot own a fourth Coding Proficiency, so they must level up one of their existing level 1 Coding Proficiencies to a level 2. They can't level up their existing level 2 Coding Proficiency, because they would have a Coding Proficiency that is two levels higher than another.

Example: 2 of the 3 owned Coding Proficiencies of Player 2 has been used during the current Sprint at the User Story task set. Thus, Player 2 only has one Coding Proficiency remaining for that Sprint. All Coding Proficiencies are made available for use at the start of each new Sprint.

Recruitment Office:

This task set allows a Player to expand their development team. A Player may place only 2 of their developers at the Recruitment Office. The two developers must be placed at the same time. At the end of the Sprint during which the 2 developers are placed, a single new developer is “hired” and added to that Player’s developer team. Two different Players cannot send their developers to the Recruitment Office during the same Sprint.

Example: Player 1 sends 2 developers to the Recruitment Office (because they chose the Recruitment Office, they must send a total of 2 developers there). No other players may visit the Recruitment Office during that Sprint. At the end of the Sprint, the Player 1’s total developer count is incremented from 5 to 6, and they remove their 2 developers from the Recruitment Office.
